Furthermore, we'd like to translate the predicted probability into a decision rule for clinical use by defining a cutoff value on the probability scale. In practice, when an individual comes in for a health check-up, the doctor would like to know the predicted probability of heart disease, for specific values of the predictors: a 45-year-old female with a max heart rate of 150.

Model performance metrics\n<p>Are the predictions accurate? How well does the model fit our data? We are going to use some common metrics to evaluate the model performance. The most straightforward one is Accuracy, which is the proportion of the total number of predictions that were correct. On the other hand, we can calculate the classification error rate using 1- accuracy. However, accuracy can be misleading when the response is rare (i.e., imbalanced response). Another popular metric, Area Under the ROC curve (AUC), has the advantage that it's independent of the change in the proportion of responders. AUC ranges from 0 to 1. The closer it gets to 1 the better the model performance. Lastly, a confusion matrix is an N X N matrix, where N is the level of outcome. For the problem at hand, we have N=2, and hence we get a 2 X 2 matrix. It cross-tabulates the predicted outcome levels against the true outcome levels.</p>\n<p>After these metrics are calculated, we'll see (from the logistic regression OR table) that older age, being male and having a lower max heart rate are all risk factors for heart disease. We can also apply our model to predict the probability of having heart disease. For a 45 years old female who has a max heart rate of 150, our model generated a heart disease probability of 0.177 indicating low risk of heart disease. Although our model has an overall accuracy of 0.71, there are cases that were misclassified as shown in the confusion matrix. One way to improve our current model is to include other relevant predictors from the dataset into our model, but that's a task for another day!</p>","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"66"},"tags":["context"],"deletable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"editable":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load Metrics package\nlibrary(Metrics)\n\n# calculate auc, accuracy, clasification error\nauc <- auc(hd_data$hd, hd_data$pred_hd)\naccuracy <- accuracy(hd_data$hd, hd_data$pred_hd)\nclassification_error <- ce(hd_data$hd, hd_data$pred_hd)\n\n# print out the metrics on to screen\nprint(paste(\"AUC=\", auc))\nprint(paste(\"Accuracy=\", accuracy))\nprint(paste(\"Classification Error=\", classification_error))\n\n# confusion matrix\ntable(hd_data$hd,hd_data$pred_hd, dnn=c('True Status','Predicted Status')) # confusion matrix","metadata":{"trusted":true,"dc":{"key":"66"},"tags":["sample_code"]},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
